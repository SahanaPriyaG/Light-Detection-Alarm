# Light-Detection-Alarm
#Objective
Design and implement a light detection alarm system using an Arduino Uno.
Components: 
  Light sensor (potentiometer)
  LED for alarm
  Push button for reset
Operation:
  Monitors ambient light levels.
   Activates alarm (LED) when light exceeds threshold.
    Manual reset with push button.
Applications:
  Security enhancement.
  Maintains optimal light in labs and galleries.
Features:
   Real-time monitoring.
   Simple, cost-effective, and easy to implement.

Need:
 Automated system to maintain appropriate light levels in security-sensitive areas and energy-efficient spaces, addressing inefficiencies and errors of manual monitoring.

Challenges:
Continuous monitoring of ambient light, providing real-time alerts when levels exceed or fall below thresholds, and incorporating a manual reset function.

Solution:
Design a light detection alarm system using Arduino Uno to detect light intensity changes, trigger alarms, and ensure efficient, real-time light management.
